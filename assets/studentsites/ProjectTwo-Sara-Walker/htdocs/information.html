The harvest produced from a set “Climate Recipe” allows identical plants to be grown anywhere in the world regardless of the natural climate of the region.</p>

                    <h3>Recipes for Life  |  Open Phenome Project</h3>
                    <p>Current technology of indoor or vertical farming is quite protected by those involved; but the MIT Media Lab Open Agriculture (OpenAg) hopes for a worldwide open-sourced digital library, like Wikipedia for farming, to promote transparency with networking and education.  OpenAg hopes to create an open dialog between the food computers to share successful climate recipes around the globe.</p>
                    <p>As more and more individuals test and perfect climate recipes in their small personal food computers the ultimate outcome is an Open Phenome Library – a comprehensive database relating environmental inputs and species-specific phenotypic outputs, that will serve as a catalog for both scientists and growers.</p>

                    <h3>There’s an App for That  |  OpenAg Brain</h3>
                    <p>The Open Agriculture Initiative is currently hosting an online community on GitHub, already allowing Food Computer “Engineers” to share their coded recipes.  From the OpenAg Recipe Bag an individual may download someone else’s code and import it into their own Food Computer to create an identical climate for the identical crop production.</p>
                    <p>The OpenAg Brain allows all users to post and share innovative ideas, recipes, solutions, and even instructions with the rest of the world of “future farmers”.</p>

                    <h3>“I want to be a farmer.”  |  Future Farmer</h3>
                    <p>One of the most incredible benefits of this personal food computer has to be the involvement of young people.  Very few young people today say, “I want to be a farmer when I grow up”, even generational farming families are seeing their youth move into new career paths, rather than continue in the “family business” of farming.  This aspect of technology merging with farming is engaging young people into a field they never knew they could be a part of.</p>
                    <p>This new technology of perfecting “climate recipes” to has the potential to create an entirely new generation of farmers of the future.</p>
