					<h2>The Future is Here</h2>
					<p>Imagine growing your own fresh food by simulating the necessary environment inside your own home, even if that home is on the 12th floor of a downtown high-rise. It sounds downright futuristic. Welcome to the future. Caleb Harper, an architect and engineer turned urban farmer, is leading the challenge to solve the world’s food problems with technology. After a trip to a tsunami disaster area in Japan where fresh food was in short supply, Harper came home to design and develop the food computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. His idea is not originial. There has been work done in aeroponics, the growing of plants without soil, since the 1920's. In the 1970's, NASA's attempts to grow plants in space revived interest in the farming method. Today, there is experimentation and advancement in aeroponics happening all over the world. What Harper is aspiring to do is to take it to the people. Looking toward the future, he is especially focusing on schools. He is promoting the personal food computer in the hopes of creating one billion new farmers.</p>

					<h2>The Pink Glowing Garden</h2>
					<p>So what is a food computer? Simply put, it’s a garden run by a computer. A robotic system programmed to create and monitor the proper environment for specific plants. Sensors collect data on a variety of environmental variables that can be manipulated by programming code referred to as climate recipes. There is no soil and no pesticides. The weather conditions are tightly controlled. While the food computer cannot match the volume of food produced in conventional farming, it does offer many benefits that are much needed in today’s world. It can provide nutritious food for isolated or difficult to reach areas, areas with unfavorable climates, and in overpopulated areas where fresh food may be in short supply.</p>

					<p>The MIT CityFarm is a big plastic pink glowing box roughly 7 feet wide and 30 feet long but Harper and his colleagues are working to reduce the size and cost so that it is readily available and affordable to the general public. He has, in fact, built many smaller desktop versions, calling them <a href="images/pfcs.png" target="_blank">personal food computers</a>, and given them to schools. Harper is heading up the Open Agriculture Initiative which provides plans and instructions for building your own personal food computer.  Known as OpenAg, the initiative is a virtual community for anyone interested in urban farming. This is reminiscent of a time half a century ago when a man named Henry Edward Roberts adapted something large and expensive (the mainframe) to something smaller and cheaper (the personal computer) that could be built from a kit kit and used at home. That, too, created and inspired its own community of sharing and expanding that we all benefit from today. Harper is hoping for the same result with the downscaling of CityFarm.</p>
					
					<h2>Creating the Perfect Environment</h2>
					<p>There are many environmental variables to be considered when growing plants and, as any farmer can tell you, hitting on the right combination for any specific plant is no easy feat. Much time is spent studying the effects of different conditions on a species of plant. In the food computer, millions of data points collected by sensors and uploaded to a database provide a formula or recipe that programmers can follow to create an atmosphere favorably for successful growth.  These recipes are shared in the OpenAg open-source community which encourages collaboration helping all scientists, whether agricultural, technological or environmental, and other interested and resourceful individuals work together to solve the world’s food problems.</p>
