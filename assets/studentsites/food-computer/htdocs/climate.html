					<h2>Here We Grow</h2>
					<p>Growing plants in the personal food computer is an ever-learning thing. In a way, the plants themselves are the teachers. Food computers compile millions of pieces of minute details gleamed from the plant that is then aggregated in a database. Algorithms process and refine these plant-provided details to create something called climate recipes. The recipes target the phenotypic traits of the plants and their biological needs. Phenotypic traits are those that involve the physical and behavioral characteristics as opposed to genotypic traits involving heredity.</p>

					<h2>Recipe to Success</h2>
					<p>The personal food computer is a climate-controlled box, its pink luminousness resembling an aquarium or photography dark room. This box has a computer brain and sensors that allow scientists, both professional and amateur, to manipulate dozens of climate variables, including:</p> 
						<ul>
							<li>Air temperature</li>
							<li>Electrical conductivity</li>
							<li>Dissolved oxygen</li>
							<li>Humidity</li>
							<li>Root-zone temperature</li>
							<li>pH levels</li>
							<li>Carbon dioxide</li>
							<li>Amount of light</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Plants grown under different conditions may vary in color, size, texture, flavor, and nutrient density. Climate conditions can even effect the amount of yield.</p>
					<p>Personal food computers are also essentially laboratories where research can be conducted to collect data on the plants’ resistance and tolerance capabilities in periods of drought and extreme weather. New plants could be developed that would survive under these unfavorable conditions. This experimentation is made possible through climate recipes that induce such environments.</p>

					<h2>Sharing of Recipes</h2>
					<p>The term <i>recipe</i> refers to a set of instructions related to successful growth factors discovered through experimentation and data collecting. It’s much like a recipe to create a culinary masterpiece except the climate recipe is written in a computer programming language. There is a variety of languages that could be used but most of the recipes available for download are in JavaScript Object Notation as known as JSON, and YAML, a superset of JSON. OpenAg encourages the sharing of recipes through the wiki on their website. Anyone can contribute to or benefit from the discoveries of others. When you find the perfect recipe, upload it and do your part to eliminate world hunger.</p>
